## Pomodoro Timer IntelliJ plugin

This plugin is [pomodoro timer](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com) for IntelliJ IDEs. 
How to use it:
 - Choose a task to be accomplished and start pomodoro timer (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
 - Work on the task until the timer rings. If distracted during pomodoro, restart timer.
 - Take a break until the timer rings again.

There are two UI with timer: widget in the bottom right of IDE window and toolwindow.
Which one is used can be configured in `IDE settings -> Other Settings -> Pomodoro`.


## Why?
Pomodoro timer is great for keeping yourself focused on particular task and avoiding distractions for a period of time.
It's also useful to make sure that you do take breaks every now and then.
And finally, it can be used for tracking how much time is spent on each task.

There doesn't seem to be many good apps simulating pomodoro timers (especially cross-platform).
So, this plugin was created.

The original version of the plugin was written by [Alex Ivanov](https://twitter.com/alexMq0) sometime in 2010.

Widget icons are reused from the great pomodoro timer app for OSX (which is no longer available) by [Ugo Landini](https://twitter.com/ugolandini).
