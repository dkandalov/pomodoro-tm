## Pomodoro Timer plugin for IntelliJ IDEs
This plugin is [pomodoro timer](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com) for IntelliJ IDEs. 
How to use it:
 - Choose a task to be accomplished and start pomodoro timer (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
 - Work on the task until the timer rings. If distracted during pomodoro, restart the timer.
 - Take a break until the timer rings again.

## Why?
Pomodoro timer is great for keeping yourself focused on particular task and avoiding distractions for a period of time.
It's also useful to make sure that you do take breaks every now and then.
And finally, it can be used for tracking how much time is spent on each task.
